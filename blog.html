        <h2>Why Local Meeting Transcription Matters for Privacy</h2>
        <div class="meta">Published February 2025 &middot; 6 min read</div>

        <p>
          Every day, millions of professionals discuss sensitive topics in virtual meetings: financial projections, HR
          decisions, client strategies, product roadmaps, and legal matters. When you use a cloud-based transcription
          service, every word of those conversations is transmitted to - and processed on - someone else's servers.
        </p>

        <h3>The Hidden Cost of Cloud Transcription</h3>
        <p>
          Most popular meeting transcription tools - Otter.ai, Fireflies.ai, tl;dv - operate on a simple model: your
          audio goes up to their cloud, gets processed, and the transcript comes back. But what happens to that audio in
          between?
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Data retention:</strong> Many services store your audio and transcripts for weeks or months,
            sometimes indefinitely, to train their models.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Third-party access:</strong> Cloud providers, subprocessors, and potentially government agencies may
            have access to your data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Compliance risk:</strong> For industries governed by GDPR, HIPAA, or SOC 2, sending meeting audio to
            third-party servers can create compliance violations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Breach exposure:</strong> Every cloud service is a potential breach target. Your meeting content
            becomes part of a larger attack surface.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Local-First Alternative</h3>
        <p>
          Local transcription eliminates these risks entirely. When transcription happens on your machine, your audio
          never leaves your PC. There's no upload, no cloud processing, and no third-party storage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meeting AI Analyser uses OpenAI's Whisper model running locally on your hardware. The transcription engine
          processes audio in real-time directly on your CPU or GPU - nothing is sent over the network.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          Your meetings contain your most sensitive business conversations. Why would you send them to a server you
          don't control?
        </blockquote>

        <h3>What About AI Analysis?</h3>
        <p>
          The one area where Meeting AI Analyser does use a cloud service is for the AI-powered analysis step - sending
          the transcript text (not audio) to Claude AI for structured summarization. This is optional and can be
          disabled entirely with the <code>--no-analysis</code> flag for fully offline operation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The key difference: a text transcript is far less sensitive than raw audio, and you have full control over
          whether to use this feature.
        </p>

        <h3>Who Benefits Most from Local Transcription?</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Consultants and freelancers</strong> handling client-sensitive information</li>
          <li><strong>Legal professionals</strong> discussing privileged matters</li>
          <li><strong>Healthcare organizations</strong> subject to HIPAA requirements</li>
          <li><strong>Financial institutions</strong> with strict data governance policies</li>
          <li><strong>Any privacy-conscious professional</strong> who values data sovereignty</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Local-first isn't just a feature - it's a philosophy. Your data, your machine, your control.</p>

        <h2>Meeting AI Analyser vs Cloud Solutions: A Comparison</h2>
        <div class="meta">Published February 2025 &middot; 7 min read</div>

        <p>
          The market for meeting transcription tools has exploded. Otter.ai, Fireflies.ai, Tactiq, and tl;dv all promise
          to capture and summarize your meetings. But they all share one fundamental design choice: your data goes to
          their cloud. Let's see how a local-first tool compares.
        </p>

        <h3>Privacy and Data Control</h3>
        <p>
          This is the most significant difference. Cloud tools require you to trust a third party with your meeting
          audio and transcripts. Meeting AI Analyser processes everything locally using the Whisper speech-to-text
          model.
        </p>
        <p>
          For organizations in regulated industries - or anyone who simply prefers to keep their conversations private -
          this is a decisive advantage.
        </p>

        <h3>Cost Structure</h3>
        <p>Cloud-based tools typically charge monthly subscriptions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Otter.ai:</strong> $17/month (Pro plan)</li>
          <li><strong>Fireflies.ai:</strong> $18/month (Pro plan)</li>
          <li><strong>Tactiq:</strong> $12/month (Pro plan)</li>
          <li><strong>tl;dv:</strong> $25/month (Pro plan)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Meeting AI Analyser offers a generous free tier with unlimited transcription. The Pro license is a one-time
          payment of €29 - no recurring costs. Over a year, that's a fraction of what you'd pay for any cloud
          alternative.
        </p>

        <h3>Meeting Bot Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Several cloud tools (Fireflies, tl;dv) work by joining your meeting as a bot participant. This creates awkward
          moments - participants see an unfamiliar name in the call, and some may feel uncomfortable knowing they're
          being recorded by a third-party service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meeting AI Analyser captures system audio directly through Windows' audio interface (WASAPI). No bot joins
          your call. Nobody in the meeting even knows you're transcribing - unless you choose to tell them.
        </p>

        <h3>Transcription Quality</h3>
        <p>
          All tools in this space use some form of speech-to-text AI. Meeting AI Analyser uses OpenAI's Whisper, which
          is widely considered one of the best open-source speech recognition models available. You can choose from
          multiple model sizes (tiny to large-v3) to balance speed and accuracy for your hardware.
        </p>

        <h3>AI Analysis Quality</h3>
        <p>
          Meeting AI Analyser uses Claude AI for meeting analysis - generating structured summaries, extracting action
          items, identifying decisions, and noting key discussion points. Claude is recognized as one of the most
          capable AI models for text understanding and summarization.
        </p>

        <h3>The Verdict</h3>
        <p>
          If privacy, cost-efficiency, and simplicity are your priorities, Meeting AI Analyser offers a compelling
          alternative to cloud-based tools. You get professional-grade transcription and AI analysis without monthly
          fees, without data leaving your machine, and without bots joining your calls.

        <h2>How to Get the Most Out of Your Meeting Notes with AI</h2>
        <div class="meta">Published February 2025 &middot; 5 min read</div>

        <p>
          Having an AI transcribe and summarize your meetings is powerful - but the real value comes from what you do
          with those summaries. Here are practical strategies to turn AI-generated meeting notes into real productivity
          gains.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Review Action Items Immediately</h3>
        <p>
          Meeting AI Analyser extracts action items with assigned owners automatically. The most effective habit is to
          review these within 15 minutes of the meeting ending. Send the action items to your task manager or share them
          with the team while the context is fresh.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Use Summaries as Stand-Up Updates</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of manually writing status updates, use your AI meeting summaries as the basis for daily stand-ups or
          weekly reports. The structured format - decisions made, items discussed, next steps - maps directly to what
          stakeholders want to know.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Build a Searchable Meeting Archive</h3>
        <p>
          With Meeting AI Analyser's history feature, every meeting is stored locally and searchable. This becomes
          invaluable when you need to recall what was decided three weeks ago, or find the meeting where a specific
          topic was discussed.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          The average professional spends 31 hours per month in unproductive meetings. AI-powered notes ensure that at
          least the productive parts are captured and actionable.
        </blockquote>

        <h3>4. Share Selectively, Not Wholesale</h3>
        <p>
          Not everyone needs the full transcript. Use the export feature to share just the summary and action items with
          stakeholders who weren't in the meeting. This respects everyone's time while keeping them informed.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Choose the Right Whisper Model</h3>
        <p>Meeting AI Analyser lets you select from multiple Whisper model sizes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>tiny/base:</strong> Fast, lower accuracy - good for quick internal calls</li>
          <li><strong>small:</strong> Balanced (default) - works well for most meetings</li>
          <li>
            <strong>medium/large-v3:</strong> Highest accuracy - ideal for important client meetings or multilingual
            calls
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Match the model to the importance of the meeting. A casual team sync doesn't need large-v3, but a client
          strategy session does.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Combine with Your Existing Workflow</h3>
        <p>
          Export meeting notes as Markdown and integrate them directly into your documentation tools - Notion, Obsidian,
          Confluence, or plain file systems. The Markdown format is universally compatible and keeps your notes
          portable.
        </p>

        <h3>Start Capturing Value Today</h3>
        <p>
          The best meeting tool is the one you actually use. Meeting AI Analyser requires zero setup - no accounts, no
          browser extensions, no meeting integrations. Launch it before your next meeting and see the difference
          immediately.
